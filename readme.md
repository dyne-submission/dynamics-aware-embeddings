# Dynamics-aware embeddings

## Usage

DynE consists of a two-stage process: first learn an embedding of the state and/or action space, then train an agent that uses that embedding. The code for learning embeddings is in `embedding/` and the code for doing RL is in `rl/`.


### Dependencies
All of these experiments use the [MuJoCo physics simulator](http://www.mujoco.org) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org). Once those are installed, `pip install mujoco-py gym imagio-ffmpeg` should hopefully get you ready to run experiments.

For visualization I use Jupyter notebooks with [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/). To install Altair, do `pip install altair vega_datasets notebook vega`.


### Training embeddings

To train the DynE action embedding on an environment, run `python main.py --env <gym_env_name>`, e.g. `python main.py --env ReacherVertical-v2`. This should only take a couple of minutes on CPU on a reasonably fast laptop.

To do DynE from pixels to learn state and action embeddings, run `python main_pixels.py --env <gym_env_name>`. This should take 1-2 hours on GPU. To make sure that your state encoder is doing something reasonable you can look at reconstructions in `results/<env name>/<experiment name>/render` as it trains.

You can also train a VAE on pixel observations using `main_vae.py` for use with `main_vae_td3.py`.

You can give your experiments a name with `--name <name>`. If you don't it will be saved as "default".


### Training TD3

You can use DynE embeddings for states, actions, or both. Run `python main_dyne.py --env_name <env> --decoder <name of your embedding run>` with the appropriate options:

- Use `--policy_name DynE-TD3` for DynE action embeddings and raw state observations
- Use `--policy_name TD3 --pixels` for DynE state embeddings and raw actions ("S-DynE")
- Use `--pixels --policy_name DynE-TD3` for embedded states and actions ("SA-DynE")

You can compare with regular TD3 by using `main_td3.py`, with TD3 from pixels using `main_pixel_td3.py`, or with TD3 from pixels but using a pretrained VAE encoder using `main_vae_td3.py`.

To see the results, run `jupyter notebook` from the root directory (`dynamics-aware-embeddings`) and open `rl_plots.ipynb`. This notebook contains functions for loading and preprocessing data as well as generating interactive plots.
